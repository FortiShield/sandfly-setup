Sandfly API Service SSL Certificate
===================================

To use your own SSL/TLS certificate for the Sandfly API service, place two
files in this directory named cert.pem and privatekey.pem.

If one or both files are present in this directory, the corresponding values
in config.server.json will be ignored (server.ssl.server.cert_signed and
server.ssl.server.private_key_signed).

cert.pem
--------

The cert.pem file must contain the server certificate and (if necessary) the
intermediate chain certificate(s).

The server certificate must be the first certificate in the cert.pem file.
Each certificate (the server certificate and the intermediate certificates)
must be PEM-encoded and include the "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and
"-----END CERTIFICATE-----" delimiters.

If you have your server certificate in certificate.pem and your intermediate
certificates in cachain.pem, you can create the cert.pem file by
concatenating them together in the correct order:

    cat certificate.pem cachain.pem > cert.pem

The complete cert.pem file should look like (without leading spaces):

    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    MII...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    MII...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ... (possibly more certificates)


privatekey.pem
--------------

The privatekey.pem file must be a PEM-encoded, unecrypted private key file.
It should look something like (without leading spaces):

    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    MII...
    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
