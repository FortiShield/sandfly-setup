* Server Config
*********************************************************************************

The Server should only have these files present:

admin.password.txt (Invalid once user logs in and changes it.)
config.server.json

*********************************************************************************
* Node Config
*********************************************************************************

The Node should only have this file present and it should be DELETED from the
server once it has been copied onto the nodes:

config.node.json

This file contains private keys that only the node should have access to for
security purposes.

If you have decided to run the server and node on the same system, then you can
leave this file but the server will give you a warning on start-up about the
security risk of doing so.
